Just like an onion,the earth is made up of several concentric layers with one inside another.The uppermost layer over the earth's surface is called the <b>crust</b>.It is the thinnest of all the layers.It is about 35km on the continental masses and only 5km on the ocean floors.<br><img src="C:\Users\saritha\Pictures\CRUST.AVIF"><BR>
The main mineral constituents of the continental mass are <b>Silca</b> and <b>alumina</b>.It is thus called <b>sial</b>.The oceanic crust mainly constitute of <b>silica</b> and <b>magnesium</b>;It is therefore called <b>sima</b>.<br>
Just beneath the cruste is the mantle which extends up to a depth of 2900 km below the crust.<br>
The innermost layer is the core with a radius of about 3500 km.It is mainly made up of nickel and ironand is called <b>nife</b>.The central core has very high temperature and pressure.<br>
