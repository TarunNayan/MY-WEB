<font size=10>The earth's crust is made up of various types of rocks.Any natural masses of mineral matter that makes up the crust is called<b>Rocks</b>.Rocks can be of different colour,size and texture.<br>
There are three major types of rocks:<b>igneous rock</b>,<b>sedimentary rock</b>and <b>metamorphic rocks</b><br>
When the molten magma cools,it becomes solid.Rocks thus formed iare called igneous rocks.They are also called<b>primary rocks</b>.There are two types of igneous rocks:<b>intrusive rocks </b>and <b>extrusive rocks</b>.<br>
Can you imagine lava coming out from the volcanoes?Lava is actually fiery red molten magma coming out from the interior of the earth on its surface.When this molten lava comes out on the earth's surface,it rapidly cools down and becomes solid.Rocks formed in such a way on the crust are called<b>extrusive igneous rocks</b>.They have a very fine grained structure.For example,basalt.The Deccan plateau is made up of basalt rocks.Sometimes,the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth's crust.Solid rocks so formed are called <b>intrusive igneous rocks</b>.Since they cool more slowly they form large grains.Granite is an example of such a rock.Grinding stones used to prepare paste/powders of spices and grains are made up of granite<br>
Rocks roll down,crack,and hit each other and are broken down into small fragments.These small particles are called <b>sediments</b>.These sediments are transported and deposited by wind,water,etc.These loose sediments are compressed and hardened to form layers of rock.These type of rocks are called <b> sedimentary rocks</b>.For example,sandstone is made from grains of sand.These rocks may also contain fossils of plants,animals and other micro organisms that once lived on them.<br>
Igneous and sedimentary rocks can change into metamorphic rock under great heat and pressure..For example,clay changes into slate and limestone into marble.<br>

Red fort is made up ofred sandstone.<br>

The taj mahal is made up of white marble.<br>
Rocks are very usefull to us . The hard rocks are used for making roads,houses and buildings.you use stones in many games.For example,seven stones, hope-scotch,five stones.Find out some more such games by asking your grand parents,parents,neighbours,etc.<br>
You will be surprise to know that one type of rock changes to another type under certain conditions in a cyclic manner.This process of transformation of rocks in a cyclic manner is called <b>rock cycle</b><br>

<p align=left>You have already learnt when the molten magma cools,it solidifies into igneous rocks.These igneous rocks  are broken down into small particles that are transported and deposited to form sedimentary rocks.When igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks are subjected to heat and pressure they change int metamorphic rock.The metamorphic rock which are still iunder great heat and pressure melt down to form molten magma.This molten magma again can cools down and solidify into igneous rocks.Rocks are made up of different minerals.Minerals are naturally occuring substances which have certain physical properties and definite chemical composition.Minerals are very important to humankind.Some are used as fuels.For example,coal,natural gas and petroleum.They are also used in industries-iron,aluminium,gold,uranium,etc,in medicine,in fertilizers,etc.
